# Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) Implementation

## Description
This repository provides efficient implementations of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) algorithm, designed to compute the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) and its inverse. The project includes the following versions:
- **Serial Implementation**: A single-threaded baseline version.
- **Parallel Implementation**: A multi-threaded version using C++ Threads.
- **Distributed Implementation**: A distributed version using MPI for large-scale computation.

## Features
- **Serial Version**: Efficient and simple single-threaded implementation.
- **Parallel Version**: Multi-core optimization using C++ Threads.
- **Distributed Version**: Scalable implementation using MPI (Message Passing Interface).
